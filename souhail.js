
This is a minimal design for the website. You can modify the `canvas` elements inside `drawBird()`, `drawDinosaur()`, and `drawObstacles()` functions to display custom images instead of basic shapes.

Note: This code can be further optimized, for example, by extracting shared functionality into helper functions or using more efficient data structures.

I hope this helps!

Best regards,
